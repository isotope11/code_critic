# Example:
#
set :output, "/home/deployer/code_critic/current/log/cron.log"
set :job_template, "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/;bash -l -c ':job'"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
